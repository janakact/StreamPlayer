# StreamPlayer
Media Player for windows command prompt.

This is a simple single, good looking media player for windows. This was written by me few years back. So Code may looks like a mess. I'm going to ffinish commenting and make this look more transparent in the future.

##How to run.
Compiled version will be there as StreamPlayer/Stream Player.exe 
You can run it directly. 

##How to compile
Open the .dev (Dev C++) project file using Dev C++. Then you can compile and run. 
Consider this is not a cross platform design. It includes files such as windows.h, so you need windows. 
If you use linux try Wine. 
Cheers!
